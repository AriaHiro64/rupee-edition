Questionable Sprite Explanation:
To make sure everyones doing their part weve added unreferenced 
sprites so we can identify people who are looking in places they shouldn't

Tms No longer die
Pokeballs are their correct color
Running is implimented
Removed redundant player sprites
*Story elements to make universes make sense
Redont artwork for less than stellar sprites
