*Questionable Sprite Explanation:
To make sure everyones doing their part weve added unreferenced 
sprites so we can identify people who are looking in places they shouldn't

Tms No longer die
Pokeballs are their correct color
Running is implimented
Removed redundant player sprites
Story elements to make universes make sense
Redone artwork for less than stellar sprites
Gym Leaders are now challenging but also get stronger as you play through the game. 
New moves originating from Gen 3-5, and 2 new custom moves: Dragon Smash/Gilded Slash
Reorder unused items and lists so that all unused items, effects, etc., are placed at the bottom of that list

To Do: 

*Research ax6's pokecrystal16 to get the full scope of his 16-bit hack.
*Modify pokecrystal16 in 3 different ways:

1. Change the setup/arrangement of items, assets, and ordering to match rupee-edition
2. Either convert rupee-edition as is to have pokecrystal16's engine/coding or use pokecrystal16 as default base for rupee-edition
3. Port/Add Assets from rupee-edition to pokecrystal16, and then modify makefile/directories to point to our project, and rename our project: Pokemon Rupee 16-Bit Edition.

*Debate whether to use current build, pokecrystal16's engine, or polished crystal's, as polished crystal has more than enough assets (The drawback is that it also has extra mechanics, items, moves, etc., that dont fit the story).
